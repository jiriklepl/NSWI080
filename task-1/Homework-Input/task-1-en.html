<p>This task aims at basic understanding of distributed objects and remote procedure invocation (RPC).
Modify a simple application to work remotely with a graph data structure and examine
how choices in working with distributed objects can affect the performance of the application.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The task is based on computing distances between pairs of nodes in a graph,
simulating work with dynamic data structures.</p>
<p>The provided Java application generates a graph, with a fixed number of nodes and randomly generated edges.
Then, it runs a benchmark, selecting random pairs of nodes in the graph, measuring the distance between them and showing the time.</p>
<p>It uses a simple breadth-first-search algorithm to measure the distance between two nodes in the graph.</p>
<p>The <code>main</code> method is in the <code>Main</code> class.</p>
<p>The node objects are instances of the <code>NodeImpl</code> class, and implement the interface <code>Node</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">interface</span> <span class="token class-name">Node</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token class-name">Set</span><span class="token generics"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span><span class="token class-name">Node</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span> <span class="token function">getNeighbors</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">addNeighbor</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">Node</span> neighbor<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>addNeighbor(Node)</code> method adds the argument node to the set of neighbors of
the receiver node object. This method is used when generating a graph.
The <code>getNeighbors()</code> method returns a set of all neighbors of the receiver node
and is used by the distance computation algorithm.</p>
<p>The actual distance computation is done through a <code>Searcher</code> interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">interface</span> <span class="token class-name">Searcher</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">static</span> <span class="token keyword">final</span> <span class="token keyword">int</span> DISTANCE_INFINITE <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">int</span> <span class="token function">getDistance</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token class-name">Node</span> from<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token class-name">Node</span> to<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This interface is implemented by the <code>SearcherImpl</code> class.
The <code>getDistance(Node, Node)</code> method computes and returns the distance between nodes <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>.
If <code>to</code> is not reachable from <code>from</code>, it returns <code>DISTANCE_INFINITE</code>.</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>Download the example and local implementation from: <a href="https://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/legacy/files/teaching/nswi080/labs/Files/sources-1.zip">https://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/legacy/files/teaching/nswi080/labs/Files/sources-1.zip</a></p>
<p>The task requires understanding of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition of a remotely accessible interface <br>
(interface <code>java.rmi.Remote</code>, exception <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code>).</li>
<li>Implementation of a remotely accessible object <br>
(class <code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>, inheriting from this class,
method <code>exportObject</code>)</li>
<li>Connecting the client and server using the RMI registry <br>
(class <code>java.rmi.Naming</code>, the <code>rmiregistry</code> application)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your tasks are</h2>
<h3>1. Local measurement</h3>
<p>Explore the provided implementation of the task that works locally.</p>
<p><strong>Measure</strong> the speed of execution on several randomly generated
graphs, with different densities, from sparse to dense.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose a fixed number of nodes (choose with regards to variants that will follow) and measure for a different number of edges</li>
<li>Make a chart showing how the time of the query depends on the distance between the nodes and on the density of the graph</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Remote Searcher</h3>
<p>Create a server that would provide a remotely accessible object
with the <code>Searcher</code> interface.
Update the provided implementation to allow searching using the remote
searcher object through the <code>Searcher</code> remote interface.
The server object with the <code>Searcher</code> interface should accept node objects
from the client.
The nodes implement <code>Node</code> interface, and must not be remotely accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Measure</strong> the speed of the implemented variants and show how the times depend on the distance and density.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How does the server <code>Searcher</code> object access the <code>Node</code> objects and the set of their neighbors?</p>
<ul>
<li>The application will now consist of a client and a server.
The client will look up a reference to the remote <code>Searcher</code> at startup using <code>java.rmi.Naming.lookup(path)</code>.</li>
<li>Keep the code of both the server and the client in the same directory (no need for projects, packages).
We want to avoid setting permissions for codebase etc.</li>
<li>Use launcher scripts from the Example.</li>
<li>Run the <code>rmiregistry</code> application in background.
<ul>
<li>If port is in use, choose a different port number (&gt; 1024)
<ul>
<li>Edit path in calls to <code>[re]bind()</code> and <code>lookup()</code></li>
<li><code>localhost</code> becomes <code>localhost:1234</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modify the <code>Searcher</code> interface (see <code>Example</code>), using the <code>java.rmi.Remote</code> interface and
the exception class <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code>.</li>
<li>The remotely accessible object (see <code>ExampleImpl</code>) must be exported. There are 2 ways:
<ul>
<li>Derive from <code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>.</li>
<li>Call <code>UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(obj)</code> manually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can use the same class to implement the local searcher on the client and the remote one on the server.
But make sure that the client does not export any local objects.</li>
<li>Keep the possibility to measure searches using the local searcher.
You can simply use both <code>Searcher</code> implementations after each other on the same pair of nodes in the graph to measure both variants.
Add call to remote <code>Searcher.getDistance()</code> with local <code>Node</code> objects to the <code>searchBenchmark()</code> method.</li>
<li>Just print an additional row or add a column to results in <code>searchBenchmark()</code>.</li>
<li>You may encounter a <code>StackOverflowError</code> when using a large graph. In that case, you can increase the stack size limit using the <code>-Xss</code> option.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Remote Nodes</h3>
<p>Update the server to provide remotely accessible objects with
the <code>Node</code> interface that would be created upon client request.
Update the provided implementation to allow computation of
distance in the graph using a local <code>Searcher</code> working with server
<code>Node</code> objects along the existing functionality.</p>
<p>To create and return <code>Node</code> instances for client requests,
define and implement a new <code>NodeFactory</code> interface with method <code>createNode()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Measure</strong> the speed again anf show how the times depend on the distance and density.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How does the local <code>Searcher</code> object access the server <code>Node</code>
objects? What exactly does the <code>NodeFactory</code> return to the client from <code>createNode</code>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify the interface <code>Node</code> to support RMI (like <code>Searcher</code> in the previous step).</li>
<li><code>NodeFactory</code> is designed similarly to <code>Searcher</code> – it has an interface with RMI, an implementing class,
create and call <code>Naming.bind</code> inside the existing server.</li>
<li>Client gets the reference to the <code>NodeFactory</code> using <code>lookup</code>, then it creates the remote
<code>Node</code> objects together with the local graph.</li>
<li>The remote graph is just another array <code>Node[]</code> on the client, so it is easy to use both the local and remote graph.</li>
<li>Do not forget that it is necessary to measure the same graphs (local and remote ones) to get a relevant comparison.
When generating the edges, add the same edges to both graphs.</li>
<li>Do not create a standalone server, we want just one server for the next variant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Remote Nodes and Searcher</h3>
<p>Add another variant: compute the distance using the remote
<code>Searcher</code> object on the server, to which you pass (from the client)
the remote <code>Node</code> objects from the server graph.</p>
<p><strong>Measure</strong> the speed again and show how the times depend on the distance and density.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How does the server <code>Searcher</code> access the server <code>Node</code>
objects (on the same server)?</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything is ready, just add this variant to <code>searchBenchmark()</code> and
compare the speed</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Impact of the Network</h3>
<p>So far, client and server were running on the same machine, with the
overhead of RMI communication, but no network latency.</p>
<p><strong>Compare</strong> the speed of the four variants when both client and server
are running on the same machine. Measure everything in one run to ease comparison.
Plot the results into a chart with four data series corresponding to the four variants.</p>
<p><strong>Explain</strong> the cause of the differences in the times.</p>
<p>Do the same for a situation when client and server
are on different physical computers connected by a network.
Test in a higher latency environment, e.g. between your computer and
a computer in the school lab.</p>
<p><strong>Compare</strong> the results of the two situations.
(To measure the same graphs, use a fixed random number generator seed.)</p>
<p><strong>Explain</strong> the cause of the differences in the times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change paths in <code>[re]bind()</code> and <code>lookup()</code>, to the remote machine name instead of <code>localhost</code>.
Ideally, use program argument to allow specifying the host name when starting the client.</li>
<li>Run <code>rmiregistry</code> and <code>Server</code> in SSH session on the remote machine.</li>
<li>Run the client locally.</li>
<li>Beware of <code>CLASSPATH</code>. Make sure the server has access to the required class files.
You can simply compile the sources on the server.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Passing by Value vs. Passing by Reference</h3>
<p>Results of the previous measurements in variants 2 and 3 help to distinguish when
it is faster to pass dynamic data structures by value and when it
is faster to pass them by reference.
The assignment demonstrates this on extreme all-or-nothing cases
when either everything is passed by value or everything is passed
by reference.
But often a combination of both is the right choice.</p>
<p>In the provided implementation of the <code>Searcher</code> interface,
there is another method for computing the distance,
<code>getTransitiveDistance(int,Node,Node)</code>.
This method in each step retrieves not only
direct neighbors of a node, but a whole set of neighbors that are at most
as far from the node as specified by the first argument.</p>
<p>This algorithm uses the <code>getTransitiveNeighbors(int)</code>
method of the <code>Node</code> interface that returns all neighbors
that are close enough -- i.e. that are accessible by at most <em>n</em> edges
where <em>n</em> is an argument to that method.</p>
<p>Use this algorithm and measure the speed for different values of the argument <em>n</em>.
Find out for which values of the argument
the measured times are comparable to those obtained from
the settings described in 2 and 3.
Use randomly generated sparse and dense graphs and test in a higher latency environment.</p>
