# Task 2

This folder contains the [CPP server](cpp/) and a [JAVA client](java/) implemented according to the [task assignment](task-2-en.html).

There are 3 more branches with updates to the protocol:

- [client](https://github.com/jiriklepl/NSWI080/tree/updated_client/thrift/Task-Interface)
- [server](https://github.com/jiriklepl/NSWI080/tree/updated_server/thrift/Task-Interface)
- [both](https://github.com/jiriklepl/NSWI080/tree/updated_both/thrift/Task-Interface)

All combinations work, but having the updated server with the original client means the reports will not match if the user requests the updated items
